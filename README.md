# VTK
This is an interactive VTK program to explore the iso-surfaces of a volume dataset.

The user will be able to interactively define the iso-value using a slider (VTK Slider Widget), and the program will display the corresponding iso-surfaces interactively. The user will also be able to examine each iso-surafce indvidually using the VTK interactor. 
The program is tested on two datasets:
a. The Iron Protein dataset (attached, in vtk data format).
b. A 100^3 samlping dataset of the quadric function.

Programming Environment used : Python 2.7 package = VTK 5.1
